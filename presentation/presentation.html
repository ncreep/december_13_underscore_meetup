_Functional programming combines the flexibility and power of abstract mathematics with the intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics._
---

## Introduction

- This is going to be an introduction to some not so basic Functional programming concepts, from the point of view of an OO programmer.

- I'll be assuming that you are comfortable with the more basic concepts like recursion and higher order functions.

- If not, we have a quick warm up ahead of us, so I hope you do get up to speed.

---

## Why?

- I'm guessing that if you came to this meetup, you probably have a reason to be interested in FP.

- So I won't spend much time convincing you about it.

- Here are some reasons:

  * composability
  * powerful abstractions
  * immutability
  * purity
  * concurrency
  * scalability
  * testability
  * elegance
  * mathematical inclination
  * ...
  
- Pick any one of those, or others, and just hold on to it during the lecture.
  
---

## What?

- A natural question in this context is: what is Functional programming?

- Just as with Object Orientation, there is no real consensus on what that is.

- For our purposes, it's just going to be a programming style that puts the usage of (pure) functions to the forefront.

- Not a very useful definition, but that will have to do.

---
## How?

- To make the whole thing closer to the OO world, we are going to pick several well-known OO design patterns and try to reimplement
them using Functional style.

- As a caveat, note that in Scala, being a hybrid OO/FP language, in some cases it might be actually  more appropriate to use a non-FP approach.

- But we are going to ignore this for the purposes of this lecture.

## Warm up: Iterator

---

In typical OO code we use an external iterator to traverse a collection:

``` 
case class Bug(c: Code)
case class Feature(c: Code)

val bugs: List[Bug] = List(Bug("null"), Bug("???"), Bug("var x = 3"))

val bugsIter = bugs.iterator
val featureBuffer = ListBuffer[Feature]()

while(bugsIter.hasNext) {
  featureBuffer += Feature(bugsIter.next().c)
}

val features = featureBuffer.toList

// => List(Feature(null), Feature(???), Feature(var x = 3))
```

---

In Scala, we typically use an internal iterator:

``` 
case class Bug(c: Code)
case class Feature(c: Code)
  
val bugs: List[Bug] = List(Bug("null"), Bug("???"), Bug("var x = 3"))

val features: List[Feature] = bugs map (b => Feature(b.c))

// or we can use 'for' notation
val features2: List[Feature] = for (b <- bugs) yield Feature(b.c)

// => List(Feature(null), Feature(???), Feature(var x = 3))
```

---

Internal iterators combine nicely.

For example, we can use `flatMap` to achieve nested iteration:
```
case class Programmer(assignedBugs: List[Bug])

val p1 = Programmer(List(Bug("null"), Bug("???"), Bug("var x = 3")))
val p2 = Programmer(List(Bug("foo.asInstanceOf[Bar]"), Bug("1 = 2")))
val ps = List(p1, p2)
  
val allFeatures: List[Feature] = 
  ps flatMap (p => p.assignedBugs map (b => Feature(b.c)))

// List(Feature(null), Feature(???), Feature(var x = 3), 
//      Feature(foo.asInstanceOf[Bar]), Feature(1 = 2))
```

---
Or even nicer with `for` notation:
```
val allFeatures: List[Feature] = for {
  p <- ps
  b <- p.assignedBugs
} yield Feature(b.c)
```
  
There are many other collection combinators, but not today...

## Warm up: Null object

---

Two common ways to deal with missing values in mainstream OO:

  - null 
  - null object pattern

The first is ugly, the second is verbose.
---

We start with the ugly:

```
// choose a random item from the two
def choose[A](x: A, y: A): A = if (util.Random.nextDouble() < 0.5) x else y

case class Coffee(amount: Int) {
  def writeCode(): Code = choose(Code(s"$amount coffee => code"), null)
}

case class Code(code: String) {
  def tryCompile(): Compiled = choose(Compiled(code), null)
}

case class Compiled(code: String)

def getCoffee(): Coffee = choose(Coffee(3), null)

val compiledCode = {
  val coffee = getCoffee()
  if (coffee == null) null
  else {
    val code = coffee.writeCode()
    if (code == null) null
    else code.tryCompile()
  }
}

// either 'null' or 'Compiled(3 coffee => code)'
```

---

And now to the verbose:
```
trait Coffee { def writeCode(): Code }
case class RealCoffee(amount: Int) extends Coffee {
  def writeCode(): Code = choose(RealCode(s"$amount coffee => code"), NoCode)
}
case object NoCoffee extends Coffee { def writeCode(): Code = NoCode }

trait Code { def tryCompile(): Compiled }
case class RealCode(code: String) extends Code {
  def tryCompile(): Compiled = choose(RealCompiled(code), NotCompiled)
}
case object NoCode extends Code { def tryCompile(): Compiled = NotCompiled }

trait Compiled
case class RealCompiled(code: String) extends Compiled
case object NotCompiled extends Compiled

def getCoffee(): Coffee = choose(RealCoffee(3), NoCoffee)

val compiledCode = getCoffee().writeCode().tryCompile()

// either 'NotCompiled' or 'RealCompiled(3 coffee => code)'
```
   
---

Null objects are safer, but require way too much boilerplate for every case. In return:

- we don't get any help from the compiler
- there is no generic way to compose different null objects

Let's look at the FP alternative, `Option`.

---

First a naive approach:
```
case class Coffee(amount: Int) {
  def writeCode(): Option[Code] = 
    choose(Some(Code(s"$amount coffee => code")), None)
}

case class Code(code: String) {
  def tryCompile(): Option[Compiled] = choose(Some(Compiled(code)), None)
}

case class Compiled(code: String)

def getCoffee(): Option[Coffee] = choose(Some(Coffee(3)), None)

val compiledCode: Option[Compiled] = getCoffee match {
  case Some(coffee) => coffee.writeCode() match {
    case Some(code) => code.tryCompile()
    case None => None
  }
  case None => None
}

// either 'None' or 'Some(Compiled(3 coffee => code))'
```
That's not much better than explicit `null` checking (although safer).

---

Let's use some combinators:
```
case class Coffee(amount: Int) {
  def writeCode(): Option[Code] = 
    choose(Some(Code(s"$amount coffee => code")), None)
}

case class Code(code: String) {
  def tryCompile(): Option[Compiled] = choose(Some(Compiled(code)), None)
}

case class Compiled(code: String)

def getCoffee(): Option[Coffee] = choose(Some(Coffee(3)), None)

val compiledCode: Option[Compiled] = 
  getCoffee flatMap { coffee =>
    coffee.writeCode() flatMap { code =>
      code.tryCompile()
    }
  }
      
// either 'None' or 'Some(Compiled(3 coffee => code))'
```

---

But remembering that `Option` is like a list of 0 or 1 items, we can use the `for` notation from before:

```
val compiledCode: Option[Compiled] = 
  for {
    coffee <- getCoffee
    code <- coffee.writeCode()
    compiled <- code.tryCompile()
  } yield compiled
      
// either 'None' or 'Some(Compiled(3 coffee => code))'
```

Much nicer...

Now that we're all warmed up, we can move on to something more challenging

##  The decorator pattern

---
- The decorator pattern is used to create different combinations of object behaviors.

- Probably the most Scala-esque way to achieve this is the [stackable trait pattern](http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/stackable_trait_pattern.html).

- But we'll stick to the more convetional version of the pattern.

---

We are going to model some simple attributes of programers. 

The interface is
```
trait Programmer {
  def makeCode(coffee: Coffee): LOC
  def price: Money
  def acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean
}
```

And a basic implementation
```
class BasicProgrammer(experience: XPPoints,
                      coffeeConsumption: Coffee,
                      languages: Set[Language]) extends Programmer {

  /* more coffee -> more code */
  def makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC =
    experience * math.max(0, c - coffeeConsumption)

  def price: Money = experience * languages.size

  def acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean = languages(l)
}
```

---

We need a default decorator that forwards all method calls to another `Programmer`:

```
abstract class ProgrammerDecorator(p: Programmer) extends Programmer {
  def makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC = p.makeCode(c)
  def price: Money = p.price
  def acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean = p.acceptProject(l)
}
```

---

And here are some concrete decorators:

```
/* a programmer that writes tests */
class TestingProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC = super.makeCode(c - 5) * 3
  override def price: Money = super.price * 2
}

/* a programmer that writes documentation */
class DocumentingProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def price: Money = super.price * 10
}

class SaneProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def acceptProject(l): Boolean =
    if (l == "PHP") false
    else super.acceptProject(l)
}

/* a programmer that likes learning new languages */
class PolyglotProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def acceptProject(l): Boolean = !super.acceptProject(l)
}
```

---

We can create different `Programmer`s by combining the different decorators

```
val base = new BasicProgrammer(
  experience = 10, 
  coffeeConsumption = 30, 
  languages = Set("Scala", "Java", "PHP"))

val saneDocTest = 
  new SaneProgrammer(new DocumentingProgrammer(new TestingProgrammer(base)))
  
val documentingPolyglot = new PolyglotProgrammer(new DocumentingProgrammer(base))

base.price // 30
base.makeCode(40) // 100
base.acceptProject("PHP") // true

saneDocTest.price // 600
saneDocTest.makeCode(40) // 150
saneDocTest.acceptProject("PHP") // false

documentingPolyglot.price // 300
documentingPolyglot.makeCode(40) // 100
documentingPolyglot.acceptProject("PHP") // false
```

---

- Now, let's look at this problem from a Functional perspective.

- We need to rephrase the problem in terms of functions that are separate from the data thy operate on.

- Because of the implicit `this`, we can view method calls as:
<table class="codeTable">
<tr><td>`prog.price()`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`price(prog)`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.makeCode(coffee)`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`makeCode(prog, coffee)`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.acceptProject(lang)`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`acceptProject(prog, lang)`</td></tr>
</table>

- Or using types
<table class="codeTable">
<tr><td>`prog.price(): Money`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`Programmer => Money`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`Programmer => (Coffee => LOC)`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`Programmer => (Language => Boolean)`</td></tr>
</table>

---

- Viewed this way, the call to `super` is like function chaining
.codeTable[
`TestingProgrammer(DocumentingProgrammer(prog)).price()`  
`-->`  
`testPrice(docPrice(price(prog)))`
]

- With types
.codeTable[
`TestingProgrammer(DocumentingProgrammer(prog)).price()`  
`-->`  
`(Programmer => Money) andThen (Money => Money) andThen (Money => Money)`  
&nbsp;  
`(f andThen g)(x) == g(f(x))`
]

- So decoration is (almost) function composition

- Let's code it up

---
First we need our data
```
case class Programmer(experience: XPPoints,
                      coffeeConsumption: Coffee,
                      languages: Set[Language])
```

With our basic functions
```
val makeCode: Programmer => (Coffee => LOC) =
  p => 
    c => p.experience * math.max(0, c - p.coffeeConsumption)

val price: Programmer => Money =
  p => p.experience * p.languages.size

val acceptProject: Programmer => (Language => Boolean) =
  p => 
    l => p.languages(l)
```

---

Which can be used like so
```
val p = Programmer(
  experience = 10, 
  coffeeConsumption = 30, 
  languages = Set("Scala", "Java", "PHP"))

price(p) // 30
makeCode(p)(40) // 100
acceptProject(p)("PHP") // true
```

---

The decorators:
```
val testMakeCode: (Coffee => LOC) => (Coffee => LOC) =
  mc =>
    c => mc(c - 5) * 3

val testPrice: Money => Money = 
  m => m * 2

val docPrice: Money => Money = 
  m => m * 10

val saneAccept: (Language => Boolean) => (Language => Boolean) =
  ap =>
    l => if (l == "PHP") false else ap(l)

val polyAccept: (Language => Boolean) => (Language => Boolean) =
  ap =>
    l => !ap(l)
```

---
We can now imitate the decorator combinations from before
```
val testMC = makeCode andThen testMakeCode
val testDocPrice = price andThen testPrice andThen docPrice
val saneAcc = acceptProject andThen saneAccept

val docPr = price andThen docPrice
val polyAcc = acceptProject andThen polyAccept

testDocPrice(p) // 600
testMC(p)(40) // 150
saneAcc(p)("PHP") // false

docPr(p) // 300
polyAcc(p)("PHP") // false
```

Notice that we only create the functions that were actually overriden by the OO decorators.
        
---

To recap:

- Methods are just functions: `Programmer => A`

- Decorators are functions of type: `A => A`

- Decoration is (almost) function composition:  
`(Programmer => A) andThen (A => A)` `-->` `Programmer => A`

- But who said that we have to use the same `A` all over the place? Function composition works just as well with different types.

- Let's change it:  
`(Programmer => A) andThen (A => B)` `-->` `Programmer => B`
        
- To achieve this in the OO version we would have to change the `Programmer` interface for every new function that we want to define.
  
---

Here's an example

```
val shouldHire: Money => Boolean = m => m < 50

val executiveDecision1: Programmer => Boolean = 
  price andThen shouldHire
  
val executiveDecision2: Programmer => Boolean = 
  price andThen testPrice andThen shouldHire

executiveDecision1(p) // true
executiveDecision2(p) // false
```  

---

- Using function composition we can take any function chain of the form:  
`Programmer => A => (A => B) => (B => C) => ... => (C => D)`  
and turn it into a single function `Programmer => D`

- This is a step beyond what we had in the classic decorator, but we are still missing something.

- Although we didn't use it explicitly, in the original decorator, we had access to the value we wrapped. In  
```
class DocumentingProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
    override def price: Money = super.price * 10
  }
```
we could actually call whatever we want on `p`. But there's no mention of a `Programmer` down our functions chain.
  
---

- So how do we translate it back to our Functional code?

- It means that we need to have a `Programmer` available inside our decorators:
`Programmer => A => (A => Programmer => B)`

- But the `Programmer` inside the chain should be the same one we started with:  
`Programmer => A => (A => Programmer => B)` `-->` `Programmer => B`

- Let's call the function that does this `flatAndThen`

- With this function we can take any chain of the form:  
`Programmer => A => (A => Programmer => B) => (B => Programmer => C) => ... => (C => Programmer => D)`  
and turn into a single function `Programmer => D`

---

- To write down the function we'll just try to "follow the types" (down the rabbit hole) and see where it gets us.

- We'll use an implicit class to "pimp" this function directly on our functions:

```
implicit class Decorator[A](f: Programmer => A) {
  def flatAndThen[B](g: A => Programmer => B): Programmer => B =
    p => {
      val fg: Programmer => (Programmer => B) = (f andThen g)
      val toB: Programmer => B = fg(p)
      val b: B = toB(p)
      b
    }
}
```

- Notice how the same `p` is used twice.
---

Let's test out our new powers:

```
val bonus: Money => (Programmer => Money) =
  m => p => m + p.experience
  
val withBonus: Programmer => Money = 
  price andThen testPrice flatAndThen bonus

withBonus(p) // 70
```

```
// with enough coffee, even a dead programmer can produce code
val deadProgrammer: (Coffee => LOC) => Programmer => (Coffee => LOC) =
  mc => p =>
    c => if (c > 4 * p.coffeeConsumption) mc(c) else 0
    
val deadMake: Programmer => (Coffee => LOC) = 
  makeCode flatAndThen deadProgrammer andThen testMakeCode
  
deadMake(p)(50) // 0
deadMake(p)(130) // 2850
```

---

We can also combine a number of `Programmer` functions:

```
val costEffective: Programmer => (Coffee => Boolean) =
  makeCode flatAndThen { mc =>
    price andThen { pr =>
      mc andThen (loc => loc > pr)
    }
  }
    
costEffective2(p)(30) // false
costEffective2(p)(120) // true
```


- `makeCode` is like a container for a `Coffee => LOC` function value, and `price` is a container for a `Money` value.

- `andThen` and `flatAndThen` help us reach inside the container and manipulate its contents (sounds familiar?).
---

- The values depend on the `Programmer` instance that we are going to provide in the future.

- Kind of like Dependency Injection.

- But it's becoming a bit clumsy to write, we'll address this issue later on.

##The decorator pattern - summary

- OO decoration is similar to FP (flattened) function composition.

- OO decoration works well when we have a fixed set of functions and many types of data.

- FP decoration works well when we have a fixed set of data types and many functions to calculate over them.

- Because of how function composition works, when used in the right context, FP decoration is much more flexible and lightweight than the OO counterpart.

This concludes the lighter part of the talk, brace yourself...

## The interpreter pattern

---

- The interpreter pattern is used when your language does not provide you with the right level of abstraction for the task at hand.

- So you create your own Domain-Specific Language and embed it in the host language.

- Nothing particularly OO about this. Typically, you represent the language as a `Composite`, and you interpret it using a `Visitor`.

- Both patterns are pretty much lifted from FP, so we'll skip the OO implementation this time.

- Scala has a number of ways to create DSLs, e.g.: higher order functions, macros, string interpolators.

- We'll try to come up with a way that works particularly well with separating the language from its interpretation.

---

- Our domain is going to be the actions that a programmer performs during work:

    * drink coffee
    * write code
    * compile
    * commit code
    * bang head on keyboard

- We would like to interconnect the different actions, so that one leads to another.

- We also want to have interaction with the outer world. 

- For example, compilation produces some response from outside, and based on this response we choose the next action.

- But we do not want our language to know anything about how to obtain the responses, the interpreter will be responsible for that.

---

Code speaks louder than words:

```
sealed trait ProgAction

case class DrinkCoffee(c: Cups, next: Coffee => ProgAction) extends ProgAction
case class WriteCode(c: Coffee, next: Code => ProgAction) extends ProgAction
case class Compile(c: Code, next: CompileResponse => ProgAction) extends ProgAction
case class CommitCode(c: Code) extends ProgAction
case object BangHeadOnKeyboard extends ProgAction

sealed trait CompileResponse

case class WaitTime(t: Time) extends CompileResponse
case object Exception extends CompileResponse
case object ScaryTypeException extends CompileResponse
```

---

When we say `ScaryTypeException` we mean:

```
5862.scala:36: error: type mismatch;

scala.collection.mutable.Builder[(MapReduceJob.this.DataSource,
scala.collection.mutable.Set[test.TaggedMapper[_, _, _]])
...
```
and so on for another 200 lines

---

We can try and write a simple program:

```
val prog: ProgAction = DrinkCoffee(3,
  coffee => WriteCode(coffee,
    code => Compile(code,
      compileResponse => compileResponse match {
        case WaitTime(_) => CommitCode(code)
        case _ => BangHeadOnKeyboard
      })))
```

Kind of messy, but works.

---

But we have a problem, what if we want write snippets of actions and combine them together:

```
val drinkWrite: ProgAction = DrinkCoffee(3,
  coffee => WriteCode(coffee,
    code => ???
  ))

val compile: Code => ProgAction = code => Compile(code,
  compileResponse => ???)
  
drinkWrite next compile
```

- We don't have a `next` function.
- Nor do the types work out even if we did.
- And what do we put instead of the `???`?

---

- The first snippet worked because we ended with either `CommitCode` or `BangHeadOnKeyboard`, both of those do not require any further actions.

- But that's not the case with the other actions, we can't finish a snippet with any of those.

- Let's loosen up the types a little bit, and see whether we can make this work:

```
sealed trait ProgAction[+A]

case class DrinkCoffee[A](c: Cups, next: Coffee => A) extends ProgAction[A]
case class WriteCode[A](c: Coffee, next: Code => A) extends ProgAction[A]
case class Compile[A](c: Code, next: CompileResponse => A) extends ProgAction[A]
case class CommitCode(c: Code) extends ProgAction[Nothing]
case object BangHeadOnKeyboard extends ProgAction[Nothing]
```

- Now that the type is general, maybe we can use it to stub out arbitrary chains.

---

For this purpose, we are going to introduce some glue:

```
sealed trait Program[+A]
case class Glue[A](pa: ProgAction[Program[A]]) extends Program[A]
case class Return[A](a: A) extends Program[A]
```

- A `Program` is just a wrapper around some value of type `A`.

- `Glue` sticks pieces of `ProgAction`s together, and `Return` lets us stub out a chain, returning the contained value.

---

- Let's see some examples:

```
val drink: Program[Coffee] =
  Glue(
    DrinkCoffee(3,
      coffee => Return(coffee)))

val drinkWrite: Program[Code] =
  Glue(
    DrinkCoffee(1,
      coffee => Glue(
        WriteCode(coffee,
          code => Return(code)))))
```

- Each `Program` snippet contains the response for the action wrapped in a `Return`.
---


- Stubbing done, what about the `next` function?

- Using the language of `Program`, we have the following types:

```
val drinkWrite: Program[Code]
val compile: Code => Program[CompileResponse]
val drinkWriteCompile: Program[CompileResponse] = drinkWrite next compile

def next[A, B]: Program[A] => (A => Program[B]) => Program[B]
```

- `next` should reach into our program, fetch the `A` value, apply a function to it, and produce a new `Program`.

---

We code `next` as a method on `Program`. Start with the easy case, `Return`:

```
sealed trait Program[+A] {
  def next[B](f: A => Program[B]): Program[B] = this match {
    case Return(a) => f(a)
    case Glue(pa: ProgAction[Program[A]]) => ???
  }
}
```

- If we see a `Return`, we unwrap it, apply the function and return its result.

- The `Glue` case is more difficult, because the `A` value is hidden inside a `ProgAction[Program[A]]`.

- We need some way to reach into the `ProgAction` and apply the function there.

---

- If we generalize the type a little, what we need is:
```
def map[A, B]: ProgAction[A] => (A => B) => ProgAction[B]
```

- Which reads as: reach into the `ProgAction`, apply the function there, and rewrap it back into a `ProgAction`.

- With these types, there is only one way to implement this function.

---

- We do it as a method on `ProgAction`:

```
sealed trait ProgAction[+A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): ProgAction[B] = this match {
    case DrinkCoffee(c, next: (Coffee => A)) => DrinkCoffee(c, next andThen f)
    case WriteCode(c, next: (Code => A)) => WriteCode(c, next andThen f)
    case Compile(c, next: (CompileResponse => A)) => Compile(c, next andThen f)
    case CommitCode(c) => CommitCode(c)
    case BangHeadOnKeyboard => BangHeadOnKeyboard
  }
}
```

- Any `ProgAction` that has a `next` function, just composes `f` after its own `next`.

- The final `ProgAction`s ignore it altogether.

---

Now that we can reach into our `ProgAction`s, we can complete the definition of `next`:

```
sealed trait Program[+A] {
  def next[B](f: A => Program[B]): Program[B] = this match {
    case Return(a) => f(a)
    case Glue(pa: ProgAction[Program[A]]) => {
      val progActionB: ProgAction[Program[B]] = pa map { (p: Program[A]) =>
        val pb: Program[B] = p next f
        pb
      }
      Glue(progActionB)
    }
  }
}
```

In the `Glue` case we recursively apply `f` until we either hit a `Return` or a final `ProgAction`.

---

Finally, we can compose our `ProgAction`s:

```
val write: Program[Code] = Glue(WriteCode(3, code => Return(code)))

val compile: Code => Program[CompileResponse] =
  code => Glue(Compile(code, compileResp => Return(compileResp)))
  
val writeCompile: Program[CompileResponse] = write next compile
```

- It works! 

- Or at the very least it compiles, but that's most of what you need when you program by "following the types".

- But those references to `Glue`s are quite annoying, let's try to hide them away.

---

We can factor out the `Glue`s into a bunch of primitive functions, one for every action we have:

```
def ret[A](a: A) = Return(a)

val compile: Code => Program[CompileResponse] = 
  code => Glue(Compile(code, cr => ret(cr)))
  
val writeCode: Coffee => Program[Code] = 
  coffee => Glue(WriteCode(coffee, code => ret(code)))
  
val drinkCoffee: Cups => Program[Coffee] = 
  cups => Glue(DrinkCoffee(cups, coffee => ret(coffee)))
  
val bangHeadOnKeyboard: Program[Nothing] = Glue(BangHeadOnKeyboard)

val commitCode: Code => Program[Nothing] = code => Glue(CommitCode(code))
```

- There's a common pattern here, which can be factored into a separate function, I'll leave it as an exercise (you can see the solution in the repository). 

---

- We can create any `Program` we want using our primitives, the previous example becomes:

```
val writeCompile: Program[CompileResponse] = write(3) next compile
```

- And we can now write more complicated descriptions of programers:

```
val idealProgrammer: Program[Code] =
  drinkCoffee(1) next writeCode next { code =>
    compile(code) next { response =>
      response match {
        case WaitTime(_) => ret(code)
        case Exception => idealProgrammer
        case ScaryTypeException => idealProgrammer
      }
    }
  }
```

- The ideal programmer just keeps writing code until it compiles and does not abuse coffee.

---

```
val nervousProgrammer: Program[Code] =
  drinkCoffee(1) next writeCode next { code =>
    compile(code) next { response =>
      response match {
        case WaitTime(t) => drinkCoffee(3 * t) next (_ => ret(code))
        case Exception => drinkCoffee(1) next (_ => nervousProgrammer)
        case ScaryTypeException => bangHeadOnKeyboard
      }
    }
  }
```

- The nervous programmer abuses coffee, without actually turning it into code...

---

- Now that we have a language, it would be a bit pointless if we don't do something with it. 

- Let's hack up an interpreter for it. 

---

Our interpreter is just a pretty printer:

```
val codeToResponse = Map(
  "java code" -> WaitTime(1),
  "scala code" -> WaitTime(20),
  "implicits spaghetti" -> WaitTime(400),
  "null abuse" -> Exception,
  "higher kinded madness" -> ScaryTypeException)

def randomCode(): Code = Random.shuffle(codeToResponse.keys.toList).head
  
def print(p: Program[_]): Unit = p match {
  case Return(a) => println(a)
  case Glue(pa) => pa match {
    case Compile(code, next) =>
      println(s"Compile: '$code'")
      print(next(codeToResponse(code)))
    case WriteCode(cofee, next) =>
      println(s"Write with $cofee coffee")
      print(next(randomCode()))
    case DrinkCoffee(cups, next) =>
      println(s"Drink coffee: $cups")
      print(next(cups * 3))
    case BangHeadOnKeyboard => println("Bang head on keyboard")
    case CommitCode(code) => println(s"Commit: '$code'")
  }
}
```

---

We can try to run it on our programmers:
```
print(idealProgrammer next commitCode)
```

```asciidoc
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'higher kinded madness'
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'java code'
Commit: 'java code'
```

```
print(nervousProgrammer next commitCode)
```

```asciidoc
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'null abuse'
Drink coffee: 2
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'higher kinded madness'
Bang head on keyboard
```

---

- In the same vein, we can write other kinds of interpreters.

- You can see couple of other examples in the repository. 

- One counts the amount of coffee the programmer consumes. 

- The other fetches the code that the programmer produced.

##The interpreter pattern - summary

- We have managed to define a small language using composable parts.

- This sort of composability would be hard to achieve with OO techniques.

- But may be overkill for simpler languages.

- This technique is (way) more general than what we did here, we'll discuss it in a moment.

The heavy lifting is done, now let's step back to get some perspective

## Design patterns - redux

---

- Remember how way back on one of the first slides we dissed design patterns?

- Let's drop the "design" and just look for patterns.

- Do we see any in the different FP examples thus far?

---

Here's one:

```
type ForProg[A] = Programmer => A

def flatMap[A, B]:     List[A]    => (A => List[B])    => List[B]
def flatMap[A, B]:     Option[A]  => (A => Option[B])  => Option[B]
def flatAndThen[A, B]: ForProg[A] => (A => ForProg[B]) => ForProg[B]
def next[A, B]:        Program[A] => (A => Program[B]) => Program[B]
```

Fixing the commonality:

```
def flatMap[A, B]: M[A] => (A => M[B]) => M[B]
```

---

Things like `M` actually have a name, which comes from abstract math, they are called Monads.

- `Programmer => A` is an instance of the Reader monad.
- `Program` is an instance of the Free monad.

With the Free monad you can do a whole lot more than just interpreters, but that's a whole topic in itself.

---

Monads are a somewhat problematic topic. 
Here are some excerpts from different Monad resources on the web:

---

- So I won't be explaining monads in this lecture. 

- But I will give you some motivation on why you should care about them.

- Once you figure out that something is a monad, you can apply generic monad functions on it.

- A concrete example in Scala is the `for` syntax.

- The `for` syntax is provided for anything that can be regarded as a monad. 

- Specifically, anything that supports `flatMap` (and `map`).

- We can rewrite some of the code from before with `for` notation (the full code is in the repository).

---

Remember the clunky decorators from before?

```
val costEffective: Programmer => (Coffee => Boolean) =
  makeCode flatAndThen { mc =>
    price andThen { pr =>
      mc andThen (loc => loc > pr)
    }
  }
```

Now we can write:

```
val costEffective = for {
  mc <- makeCode
  p <- price
} yield mc andThen (loc => loc > p)
```

---

Same goes for our `Program` examples. The nervous programmer can be rewritten as:

```
def nervousProgrammer: Program[Code] =
  for {
    code <- drinkCoffee(1) next writeCode
    response <- compile(code)
    finalCode <- response match {
      case WaitTime(t) => drinkCoffee(3 * t) next (_ => ret(code))
      case Exception => drinkCoffee(1) next (_ => nervousProgrammer)
      case ScaryTypeException => bangHeadOnKeyboard
    }
  } yield finalCode
```

---

- Monads are one of the many mathematical structures that are used in Functional programming.

- Different code patterns, become mathematical structures.

- These are the equivalents of design patterns in FP.

- Looking around for these patterns, can greatly improve the design of our code.
